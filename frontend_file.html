            <p>Waking up every day to the news of a global beauty brand making its way to India is a feeling I’ll never have enough of. So, by the power vested in me by the gods of manifestation, I hereby manifest the arrival of more and more international beauty brands in India in 2025. 

                Access to international beauty brands for the Indian market was no less than a desire, but that was back then. Now, it seems like a cakewalk for Indian vanities to witness the charm of International beauty brands. The brands that strolled in our wishlists yesterday, reign supreme in our carts today – consider this the ripple effect of India’s growing global presence. From hunting brands at the airports to having them at the luxury of your doorstep, Indian beauty sure has come a long way. Lately, we see some of the largest beauty brands placing their bets on India, indicating how we are in line to be the next big players in the global beauty market. Having said that, despite dozens of international beauty brands already reserving their spots on the Indian aisles, there still is a void that needs to be filled. 
                
                Since the heart of a beauty enthusiast always yearns for more, there is so much more that is still wandering in our wishlists. The bandwagon may have been brimming with plenty of international beauty brands, but there is still a long list demanding our attention. Names like Armani Beauty, NARs, and Yves Saint Laurent are already attracting attention in India, so here are a few more international beauty brands we are manifesting for the upcoming year. </p>

It was named after the French opera Lakmé, which itself is the French word for the goddess Lakshmi who is renowned for her beauty. It was started in 1952 as a 100% subsidiary of Tata Oil Mills, famously after Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was concerned that Indian women were spending precious foreign exchange on beauty products and persuaded JRD Tata to manufacture them in India. Simone Tata joined the company as director and went on to become chairperson. In 1998, Tatas sold their stake in Lakmé to Hindustan Unilever for ₹200 crore (US$48.46 million).  Lakmé mainly sells coloured cosmetic products such as lipsticks, eyeliners and skincare cream. In December 2018, it launched its e-commerce platform. As of 2021, Lakmé also runs 485 beauty salons under Lakmé Lever. The company is the title sponsor for Lakmé Fashion Week (LFW), a bi-annual fashion week which takes place in Mumbai.",
